### Time tracker

Time Tracker is a simple application helping you to track different moments of your day. If you have
no idea in which activities you spend more time or if you want to detect if you spend to much time
in an activity which is not a priority, this application can help you to reorganize your daily !

### Pomodoro

The application also provides a Pomodoro timer üçÖ‚è≥. The Pomodoro technique says to define several
small periods of time where you are truly focus, separated with small break to do a task. Generally,
the focus period lasts 25 minutes for 5 minutes of break. This is a time management technique.

### Alarm to start your day

You can configure the application to display a notification to remind you to track your activities.
By example, you could want a reminder link to the time you wake up.
